[2023-08-24] – rating 2/5 – I bought the ZephyrBook Pro 2023 with high hopes, but it has been nothing but a disappointment. 
From the moment I powered it on, it felt like a terrible investment. The heating issue is absurd; this laptop heats 
up faster than a toaster. It’s like having a portable oven on my lap. I can’t even use it for more than 30 minutes 
without feeling like my thighs are on fire. The customer support experience has been equally horrendous. When I 
reached out to them about the heating problem, they brushed me off, saying it’s normal for a laptop to get warm. 
Warm? No, this is scalding hot! It’s like they expect me to carry a fire extinguisher with me while using it. 
Now, let me tell you about the competition. My friend owns the sleek and efficient StarLite 2023 laptop, and it’s miles ahead. 
Not only does it stay cool as a cucumber, but it also runs like a dream. The ZephyrBook Pro 2023 can’t hold a candle to it. 
My advice to the company is simple: Invest in better hardware to manage the heating issue, and please, for the 
love of technology, improve your customer support. I regret not going for the StarLite 2023, and I wish I had made a 
wiser choice. Don’t make the same mistake I did.
