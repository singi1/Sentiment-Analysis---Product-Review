# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and
categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to
determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product,
etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

**Objective**
You are part of a multinational computer, phone, laptop and hardware manufacturer. Your objective as a product analyst is to use Generative AI, and craft an effective prompt which can take an unstructured customer review as input and return a structured response, which can be then used to take action in a manner which optimizes for the overall customer experience of your product. As you structure your data from the review, make sure to capture the date of the review, product / service in question, the rating, a short summary (upto 100 words) of the feedback for the product / service, list of actions items which can improve the product / service, any mention of competitors - if yes, what was better in their experience, the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
